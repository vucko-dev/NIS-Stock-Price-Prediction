# NIS-Stock-Price-Prediction
Predicting the minimum and maximum stock prices of NIS using MATLAB. Developed for academic purposes.

To run this properly, first, you need to run _parametri.m_, then _model.m_, and finally _racunanje_ulaza_u_model.m_. After you have run all these files, type `net(ulazi_u_model)` in the command line. Once you've done that, you should get the minimum and maximum prices for the next five days.

**Note: The data for model training is up to May 17th, 2024.**
